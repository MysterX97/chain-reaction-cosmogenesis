Inashvili’s Chain-Reactive Cosmogenesis Theory
An Alternative Model for Universe Formation, Matter Multiplication, and Life Propagation

Author: Giorgi Inashvili

Abstract
This theory proposes a novel view on the origin and evolution of the universe, matter, and life based on recursive chain-reactions of particle interactions, cosmic collisions, and chemical stability principles. It interprets the universe as emerging from an initial ultra-small object—smaller than an atom—whose cascading division and interactions have led to the formation of increasingly complex structures, including planets, black holes, and life forms. The theory introduces the concept of “chain-reactive cosmogenesis” to explain matter multiplication and cosmic diversification, and reinterprets black holes as chemically stable structures resistant to mutual destruction, thus acting as cosmic regulators. This framework also supports the panspermia hypothesis for life spreading via asteroid impacts, ultimately leading to a fractal-like propagation of life-bearing planets across galaxies.

1. Introduction
Traditional cosmology describes the Big Bang as an initial singularity and rapid inflation of space-time, followed by matter formation and galaxy evolution. This theory seeks to expand on that framework by focusing on the chain-reaction nature of matter multiplication and cosmic object formation, incorporating chemical principles and cosmic collision dynamics, while offering fresh interpretations of black hole behavior and life propagation mechanisms. ამ დოკუმენტში წარმოდგენილია ჩემი ჰიპოთეზის ზოგადი მიმოხილვა. თითოეულ ქვეთავს, მათ შორის Primal Particle-ს, შავი ხვრელების ქიმიას, ჯაჭვურ-რეაქციულ გამრავლებას და სხვა დეტალებს, მივუძღვნი ინდივიდუალურ, ვრცელ განმარტებებსა და ცალკეულ პოსტებს.

2. Starting Point: The Initial Ultra-Small Object
The universe began from an initial ultra-small “seed object” even smaller than an atom, termed here the Primal Particle (PP).

This PP was not simply a particle as currently defined but a highly condensed energy-matter state containing the potential for infinite multiplication and complexity.

It is not space existing “around” the PP; rather, space-time itself unfolded as a consequence of the PP’s chain-reactive expansion.

3. Chain-Reactive Multiplication of Matter
The PP undergoes a cascade of fissions and collisions, producing successive generations of particles and molecules, represented symbolically as x

 .

Each collision or division event creates unique but related products:

 , etc.

These chain reactions produce increasingly complex structures, including:

Diverse chemical compounds,

Planetary bodies,

Black holes.

4. Black Holes as Chemically Stable Cosmic Structures
Black holes represent a special category of matter resulting from a unique chemistry of ultra-strong bonds.

Unlike typical reactions where objects can break down or destroy each other, these bonds:

Are irreversible and indestructible by known forces,

Do not "consume" or "destroy" one another when colliding; instead, black holes merge, creating larger black holes.

Analogy:

A fire can melt ice, but one flame does not extinguish another; flames merge and grow.

Similarly, black holes unify without destruction.

5. Cosmic Collisions and Planetary Formation
Larger cosmic bodies (planets x

 ) collide, sometimes shedding fragments.

These fragments travel through space as meteoroids, asteroids, or comets.

Impacts of these fragments can seed life or alter planetary evolution on other worlds.

6. Panspermia and Life Propagation
Life-bearing fragments can travel between planets and star systems.

When impacting habitable planets within the habitable zone, these fragments may initiate or seed life.

This results in a recursive propagation:

Life originates on one planet,

Spread via cosmic fragments to others,

Continues indefinitely, forming a fractal-like distribution of life-bearing worlds.

7. Habitable Zones and Planetary Uniqueness
While many planets form from chain-reactions and cosmic collisions, habitability depends on environmental factors like:

Distance from star (habitable zone),

Plumetary atmosphere and climate,

Chemical makeup.

Therefore, life appears only where conditions allow, explaining why Earth harbors life while planets like Jupiter or Venus do not, despite similar formation processes.

8. Continuous Universe Evolution
The universe is not static, but a dynamic system where:

New planets and stars form continually,

Black holes regulate matter by absorbing and merging,

Life propagates through cosmic chain reactions.

This process is ongoing and may produce billions of life-bearing planets within galaxies and beyond over cosmic timescales.

9. Philosophical Implications
The theory supports a vision of the cosmos as a recursive, self-organizing system, with matter and life emerging from chain reactions of simpler elements.

It challenges strict reductionist views, emphasizing complexity through interaction and combination.

It also redefines black holes as chemical-stable entities, not just gravitational phenomena, acting as cosmic stabilizers.

10. Conclusion and Further Research
This theory provides a comprehensive framework integrating cosmic evolution, matter multiplication, black hole chemistry, and panspermia.

It invites further theoretical and experimental exploration, including:

Modeling chain-reaction cascades in particle physics,

Studying black hole merger chemistry analogs,

Searching for life signatures consistent with panspermia in exoplanet studies.
